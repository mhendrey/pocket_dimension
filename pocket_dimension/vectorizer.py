    Then apply the JustInTimeRandomProjection to return a lower-dimensional
    dense vector representation. The resulting vectors will be normalized to unit
    length.

    Parameters
    ----------
    d : int
        Dimension of the dense vector output. Rounded down to nearest multiple of 64 if
        not already
    cms_file : str | Path, optional
        Filename of a saved count-min sketch to use for filtering out features

    hash_dim : int, optional
        Number of dimensions that features get hashed to for the sparse vector
        representation. Should have `hash_dim >> d`. Default is the largest
        possible 2\*\*31 - 1 (~2 billion) for sklearn's FeatureHasher

    maxDF : int, optional
        Maximum document frequency (number of records with this feature) a feature
        can have to be included in the embedding. Default is 2\*\*32 - 1.
    temperature : float, optional
        Option to reshape the term frequency vector by raising each count to
        (1/temperature). Using a value above 1.0 flattens the values relative to
        each other. Using a value below 1.0 sharpens the contrast of values
        relative to each other.
    filter : pybloomfilter3, option
        Bloom filter to use for filtering features before creating sparse vectors.
        Default is None
    filter_out : bool, optional
        If True, then remove features that are in the filter before making the

        the sparse vector. Not used if `filter` is None. Default is True.

    Attributes
    ----------
    d : int
        Embedding dimension of the dense vector. Must be multiple of 64

        Efficiently projects high-dimensional sparse vectors down to lower dimensional
        dense vectors
    temperature : float
        Exponential scale raw counts by 1 / temperature when making TF vector
